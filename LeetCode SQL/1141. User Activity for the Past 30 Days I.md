### Table: Activity  

| Column Name   | Type  | Description                                                    |
|---------------|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `user_id`     | int   | ID of the user.                                                |
| `session_id`  | int   | Session ID of the activity. Each session belongs to one user.  |
| `activity_date` | date | The date the activity was recorded.                            |
| `activity_type` | enum | One of: ('open_session', 'end_session', 'scroll_down', 'send_message'). |

**Notes**:  
- The table may contain duplicate rows.  
- A user is considered **active** on a day if they performed **at least one** activity on that day.

---

## Goal  

Find the number of **distinct active users** per day for the **30-day period ending 2019-07-27 (inclusive)**.

---

### Requirements  

1. Include only the last 30 days (from `2019-06-28` to `2019-07-27`).  
2. For each day within that range where at least one user was active:  
   - Count the number of unique users who performed any activity.  
3. Return columns `day` and `active_users`.

### Example  

#### Input  

**Activity Table**  
| user_id | session_id | activity_date | activity_type |
|---------|------------|----------------|----------------|
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20     | open_session   |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20     | scroll_down    |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20     | end_session    |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-20     | open_session   |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21     | send_message   |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21     | end_session    |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21     | open_session   |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21     | send_message   |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21     | end_session    |
| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25     | open_session   |
| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25     | end_session    |

---

#### Output  

| day        | active_users |
|------------|---------------|
| 2019-07-20 | 2             |
| 2019-07-21 | 2             |

---

## Solution  

### âœ… SQL Query  
```sql
SELECT 
    activity_date AS day,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users
FROM Activity
WHERE activity_date BETWEEN DATE '2019-06-28' AND DATE '2019-07-27'
GROUP BY 1;
```

---

### Explanation  

1. **`WHERE` Clause**:  
   - Filters activity to only those within the 30-day period from `2019-06-28` to `2019-07-27`.  
2. **`GROUP BY activity_date`**:  
   - Aggregates results per calendar day.  
3. **`COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)`**:  
   - Counts unique users active on each date.  
4. **`AS day` / `AS active_users`**:  
   - Renames output columns for clarity and formatting.

---

## Notes  

- Dates with **no user activity** are automatically excluded due to `GROUP BY` behavior.  
- Sorting is optional unless required by the problem.  
- Efficient for daily usage reporting or trend analysis.
