## 1484. Group Sold Products By The Date  
**Difficulty**: Easy  
**Topics**: SQL, Grouping, Aggregation, String Functions  

### Table: Activities  

| Column Name | Type    | Description                                |
|-------------|---------|--------------------------------------------|
| sell_date   | date    | The date a product was sold                |
| product     | varchar | The name of the product sold               |

- The table may contain **duplicate rows**.  
- Each row logs the **sale of a product** on a specific date.  
- A product can be sold multiple times on the same date.  

---

## Goal  
Write an SQL query to **group all sold products by each unique sell date**, and for each date, return:  
1. The number of **distinct products sold**  
2. The names of the sold products, **sorted lexicographically and separated by commas**

## Example  

### **Input**  
**Activities Table**

| sell_date  | product     |
|------------|-------------|
| 2020-05-30 | Headphone   |
| 2020-06-01 | Pencil      |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask        |
| 2020-05-30 | Basketball  |
| 2020-06-01 | Bible       |
| 2020-06-02 | Mask        |
| 2020-05-30 | T-Shirt     |

### **Output**

| sell_date  | num_sold | products                     |
|------------|----------|------------------------------|
| 2020-05-30 | 3        | Basketball,Headphone,T-Shirt |
| 2020-06-01 | 2        | Bible,Pencil                 |
| 2020-06-02 | 1        | Mask                         |

## Explanation  
For each `sell_date`:
- Count the number of **unique products** sold that day.
- Retrieve the **distinct product names**, sort them **alphabetically**, and join them into a single comma-separated string.

---

## Solution  

### **SQL Query**  
```sql
SELECT 
    sell_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT product) AS num_sold,
    STRING_AGG(DISTINCT product, ',' ORDER BY product) AS products
FROM Activities
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

---

### **Explanation**  
1. **`COUNT(DISTINCT product)`**:  
   - Counts the number of unique products sold on each date.

2. **`STRING_AGG(DISTINCT product, ',' ORDER BY product) AS products`**:  
   - Concatenates all unique product names in **alphabetical order**, separated by commas.

3. **`GROUP BY sell_date`**:  
   - Groups the data by each unique date.

4. **`ORDER BY sell_date`**:  
   - Ensures the final output is **chronologically sorted** by date.
