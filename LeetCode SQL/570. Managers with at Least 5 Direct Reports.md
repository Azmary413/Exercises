### Table: Employee  

| Column Name | Type    | Description                                          |
|-------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`        | int     | The unique ID of each employee.                      |
| `name`      | varchar | The name of the employee.                            |
| `department`| varchar | The department to which the employee belongs.        |
| `managerId` | int     | The ID of the employee’s manager (nullable).         |

- `id` is the primary key.  
- An employee with `managerId = NULL` has no manager.  
- No employee manages themselves.

---

## Goal  
Write a query to find the names of managers who have **at least five direct reports**.

---

## Requirements  
- Return a single column `name`, which represents the **manager's name**.  
- The result can be returned in any order.

---

## Example  

### Input  
**Employee Table**  
| id  | name  | department | managerId |
|-----|-------|------------|-----------|
| 101 | John  | A          | NULL      |
| 102 | Dan   | A          | 101       |
| 103 | James | A          | 101       |
| 104 | Amy   | A          | 101       |
| 105 | Anne  | A          | 101       |
| 106 | Ron   | B          | 101       |

### Output  
| name |
|------|
| John |

---

## Solution  

### ✅ SQL Query  

```sql
SELECT name
FROM Employee
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT managerId
    FROM Employee
    WHERE managerId IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY managerId
    HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5
);
```

---

## Explanation  

1. **Subquery (FROM Employee WHERE managerId IS NOT NULL ...)**  
   - Filters only those rows where employees have managers.
   - Groups the result by `managerId` and counts the number of employees under each manager.
   - Filters those groups where the number of direct reports is **5 or more**.

2. **Outer Query (SELECT name FROM Employee WHERE id IN ...)**  
   - Retrieves the names of employees whose `id` appears as a `managerId` from the subquery.
   - These are the managers with **at least 5 direct reports**.
