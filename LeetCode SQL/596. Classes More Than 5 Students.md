### Table: Courses  

| Column Name | Type    | Description                                  |
|-------------|---------|----------------------------------------------|
| `student`   | varchar | Name of the student enrolled in a class.     |
| `class`     | varchar | Name of the class the student is enrolled in.|

**Notes**:  
- The combination `(student, class)` is the **primary key**, meaning no duplicate enrollments.  
- Each row represents one student's enrollment in a class.

---

## Goal  

Find all classes that have **at least 5 students enrolled**.

---

### Requirements  

1. Count how many students are enrolled in each class.  
2. Return only those classes where the student count is **greater than or equal to 5**.  
3. Return only the `class` column.

---

### Example  

#### Input  

**Courses Table**  
| student | class    |
|---------|----------|
| A       | Math     |
| B       | English  |
| C       | Math     |
| D       | Biology  |
| E       | Math     |
| F       | Computer |
| G       | Math     |
| H       | Math     |
| I       | Math     |

---

#### Output  

| class   |
|---------|
| Math    |

---

## Solution  

### âœ… SQL Query  
```sql
SELECT 
    class
FROM Courses
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(student) >= 5;
```

---

### Explanation  

1. **`GROUP BY class`**:  
   - Groups all students by their class.  
2. **`COUNT(student)`**:  
   - Counts how many students are in each group (i.e., per class).  
3. **`HAVING COUNT(student) >= 5`**:  
   - Filters the groups to keep only those with **5 or more students**.  
4. **`SELECT class`**:  
   - Returns just the class name for those qualifying rows.

---

## Notes  

- `HAVING` is used with aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, unlike `WHERE` which filters rows **before** grouping.  
- Output is not required to be sorted unless specified.
