### Table: Views  

| Column Name   | Type    | Description                                                              |
|---------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `article_id`  | int     | The ID of the article being viewed.                                      |
| `author_id`   | int     | The ID of the author who wrote the article.                              |
| `viewer_id`   | int     | The ID of the person who viewed the article.                             |
| `view_date`   | date    | The date when the article was viewed.                                    |

- The table does not have a primary key, meaning duplicate rows may exist.  
- **Special Note**: If `author_id` is equal to `viewer_id`, it indicates the author viewed their own article.

### Goal  
Write a query to find all **authors** who viewed at least one of their own articles.  

### Requirements  
- The result should include a single column, `id`, representing the `author_id`.  
- The output must be sorted in ascending order.

## Example  

### Input  
**Views Table**  
| article_id | author_id | viewer_id | view_date  |
|------------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| 1          | 3         | 5         | 2019-08-01 |
| 1          | 3         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 2          | 7         | 7         | 2019-08-01 |
| 2          | 7         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 4          | 7         | 1         | 2019-07-22 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |

### Output  
| id   |
|------|
| 4    |
| 7    |

---

## Solution  

### SQL Query  
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT author_id AS id
FROM Views
WHERE author_id = viewer_id
ORDER BY id ASC;
```

### Explanation  
1. **`SELECT DISTINCT` Clause**: Ensures that only unique `author_id` values are returned.  
2. **`FROM Views` Clause**: Specifies the source table.  
3. **`WHERE author_id = viewer_id` Clause**: Filters rows where the author of the article is also the viewer.  
4. **`ORDER BY id ASC` Clause**: Sorts the result in ascending order by the `id` column.

## Notes  
- This query is efficient for identifying authors who have interacted with their own content.  
- Ensures the result is clean and sorted for easier analysis or reporting.
