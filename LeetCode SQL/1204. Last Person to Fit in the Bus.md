### Table: Queue

| Column Name   | Type    | Description                                         |
|---------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `person_id`   | int     | Unique ID for each person in the queue.            |
| `person_name` | varchar | The name of the person.                            |
| `weight`      | int     | The weight of the person in kilograms.             |
| `turn`        | int     | The boarding order of the person (1 = first turn). |

- The `turn` column determines the order of boarding.
- The sum of weights for people boarding cannot exceed **1000 kg**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Find the **name of the last person who can board the bus** without the total weight exceeding **1000 kg**.

### Return:

- `person_name` â€“ the name of the last person allowed to board.

Only one person can board at a time, in the order specified by `turn`.

## ðŸ“Š Example

### Input

**Queue**

| person_id | person_name | weight | turn |
|-----------|-------------|--------|------|
| 5         | Alice       | 250    | 1    |
| 4         | Bob         | 175    | 5    |

## âœ… SQL Solution (PostgreSQL)

```sql
WITH Boarding AS (
  SELECT *,
         SUM(weight) OVER (ORDER BY turn) AS total_weight
  FROM Queue
)
SELECT person_name
FROM Boarding
WHERE total_weight <= 1000
ORDER BY total_weight DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

---

## ðŸ§  Explanation

- **`SUM(weight) OVER (ORDER BY turn)`** computes the running total of weights based on the boarding sequence.
- The `WHERE` clause ensures we consider only those whose cumulative weight does not exceed 1000 kg.
- We sort by `total_weight DESC` to get the **last person who was able to board** without breaking the limit.
- `LIMIT 1` returns that personâ€™s name.
