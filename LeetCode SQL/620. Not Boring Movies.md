## 620. Not Boring Movies  
**Difficulty**: Easy  
**Topics**: SQL, Data Filtering, Sorting  

### Table: Cinema  

| Column Name   | Type    | Description                                      |
|--------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `id`         | int     | The unique identifier for each movie (Primary Key). |
| `movie`      | varchar | The name of the movie.                           |
| `description`| varchar | A brief description of the movie.                |
| `rating`     | float   | The movie's rating, with up to 2 decimal places (Range: [0, 10]). |

- The `id` column is the **primary key**, ensuring each movie has a unique identifier.  
- The `rating` column represents a movie's quality on a **scale from 0 to 10**.  

---

## Goal  
Write a SQL query to **retrieve movies** that:  
1. Have an **odd-numbered ID**.  
2. Do **not** have a description of `"boring"`.  
3. Are sorted by `rating` in **descending order**.

## Example  

### **Input**  
**Cinema Table**  

| id | movie      | description | rating |
|----|------------|-------------|--------|
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
| 2  | Science    | fiction     | 8.5    |
| 3  | irish      | boring      | 6.2    |
| 4  | Ice song   | Fantacy     | 8.6    |
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |

### **Output**  

| id | movie      | description | rating |
|----|------------|-------------|--------|
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |

### **Explanation**  
- The movies with **odd IDs** are **1, 3, and 5**.  
- The movie with **ID = 3** is `"boring"`, so we exclude it.  
- The remaining movies (`ID = 1` and `ID = 5`) are **sorted by rating in descending order**.  

---

## Solution  

### **SQL Query**  
```sql
SELECT id, movie, description, rating
FROM Cinema
WHERE id % 2 = 1 AND description <> 'boring'
ORDER BY rating DESC;
```

### **Explanation**  
1. **`id % 2 = 1`**: Filters movies with an **odd ID**.  
2. **`description <> 'boring'`**: Excludes movies with a `"boring"` description.  
3. **`ORDER BY rating DESC`**: Sorts the result by **rating in descending order**.  

---

## Notes  
- The `id % 2 = 1` condition ensures we get only **odd-numbered IDs**.  
- The `<> 'boring'` condition removes unwanted movies.  
- Sorting by `rating DESC` ensures **higher-rated movies appear first**.
