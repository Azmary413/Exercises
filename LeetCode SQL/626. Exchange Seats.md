## ðŸ“˜ Table Definition

### Table: Seat

| Column Name | Type    | Description                         |
|-------------|---------|-------------------------------------|
| `id`        | int     | Unique ID of the student (starts at 1 and increments). |
| `student`   | varchar | The name of the student.            |

- The `id` is **continuous and sequential**.
- Each row represents one student's current seat.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Swap the seats of every **two consecutive students**.  
If the number of students is **odd**, the last student remains in their original seat.

### Return:

- The table with updated seat positions, ordered by `id` in **ascending** order.

## ðŸ“Š Example

### Input

**Seat**

| id | student |
|----|---------|
| 1  | Abbot   |
| 2  | Doris   |
| 3  | Emerson |
| 4  | Green   |
| 5  | Jeames  |

### Output

| id | student |
|----|---------|
| 1  | Doris   |
| 2  | Abbot   |
| 3  | Green   |
| 4  | Emerson |
| 5  | Jeames  |

---

## âœ… SQL Solution (PostgreSQL)

```sql
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN id % 2 = 1 AND id + 1 <= (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Seat) THEN id + 1
        WHEN id % 2 = 0 THEN id - 1
        ELSE id
    END AS id,
    student
FROM Seat
ORDER BY id;
```

---

## ðŸ§  Explanation

- **Swap Logic**:
  - If the `id` is **odd**, swap it with `id + 1`, but only if `id + 1` exists.
  - If the `id` is **even**, swap it with `id - 1`.
  - If it's the **last student** in an odd-length list, they keep their seat.
- The result is then ordered by `id` to preserve ascending order.
