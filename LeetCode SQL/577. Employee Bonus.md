### Table: Employee  

| Column Name | Type    | Description                                      |
|-------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `empId`     | int     | The unique identifier for each employee (primary key). |
| `name`      | varchar | The name of the employee.                       |
| `supervisor`| int     | The ID of the employee's manager (can be null). |
| `salary`    | int     | The salary of the employee.                     |

### Table: Bonus  

| Column Name | Type | Description                                      |
|-------------|------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `empId`     | int  | The unique identifier for each employee (foreign key referencing `Employee.empId`). |
| `bonus`     | int  | The bonus amount received by the employee (can be null). |

- The `empId` column in the `Bonus` table is a foreign key that references the `empId` column in the `Employee` table.
- The `bonus` column may contain null values if an employee has not received a bonus.

---

## Goal  
Write a query to find the `name` and `bonus` of employees whose bonus is **less than 1000**. If an employee does not have a bonus, return null for the bonus.

### Requirements  
- The result should include two columns: `name` and `bonus`.  
- The result can be returned in any order.

## Example  

### Input  
**Employee Table**  

| empId | name   | supervisor | salary |
|-------|--------|------------|--------|
| 3     | Brad   | null       | 4000   |
| 1     | John   | 3          | 1000   |
| 2     | Dan    | 3          | 2000   |
| 4     | Thomas | 3          | 4000   |

**Bonus Table**  

| empId | bonus |
|-------|-------|
| 2     | 500   |
| 4     | 2000  |

### Output  

| name  | bonus |
|-------|-------|
| Brad  | null  |
| John  | null  |
| Dan   | 500   |

### Explanation  
- Brad and John do not have a bonus entry in the `Bonus` table, so their bonus is **null**.
- Dan has a bonus of **500**, which is less than **1000**, so he is included in the result.
- Thomas has a bonus of **2000**, so he is excluded from the result.

---

## Solution  

### SQL Query  
```sql
SELECT e.name, b.bonus
FROM Employee e
LEFT JOIN Bonus b ON e.empId = b.empId
WHERE b.bonus < 1000 OR b.bonus IS NULL;
```

### Explanation  
1. **`LEFT JOIN`**: Ensures that all employees from the `Employee` table are included, even if they do not have a bonus entry in the `Bonus` table.
2. **`ON e.empId = b.empId`**: Joins employees with their respective bonuses.
3. **`WHERE b.bonus < 1000 OR b.bonus IS NULL`**: Filters employees who either:
   - Have a bonus less than **1000**.
   - Do not have a bonus entry (null values in the `bonus` column).

---

## Notes  
- The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that employees without bonuses are still included.
- The `b.bonus IS NULL` condition ensures employees with no bonus record appear in the output.
