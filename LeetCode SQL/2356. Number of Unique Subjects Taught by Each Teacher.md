### Table: Teacher  

| Column Name  | Type | Description                                                   |
|--------------|------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `teacher_id` | int  | Unique ID representing a teacher.                            |
| `subject_id` | int  | ID of the subject being taught.                              |
| `dept_id`    | int  | ID of the department offering the subject.                   |

**Notes**:  
- The combination `(subject_id, dept_id)` is a **primary key**, meaning each subject-department pair is unique.  
- A teacher may teach the same subject across multiple departments.

---

## Goal  

Write a query to **count the number of unique subjects** each teacher teaches, regardless of the department.

---

### Requirements  

1. Group by `teacher_id`.  
2. Count **distinct `subject_id`** per teacher (ignoring departments).  
3. Return the `teacher_id` and their unique subject count as `cnt`.  
4. Return results in any order.

### Example  

#### Input  

**Teacher Table**  
| teacher_id | subject_id | dept_id |
|------------|------------|---------|
| 1          | 2          | 3       |
| 1          | 2          | 4       |
| 1          | 3          | 3       |
| 2          | 1          | 1       |
| 2          | 2          | 1       |
| 2          | 3          | 1       |
| 2          | 4          | 1       |

---

#### Output  

| teacher_id | cnt |
|------------|-----|
| 1          | 2   |
| 2          | 4   |

---

### Explanation  

- **Teacher 1** teaches subject `2` in two departments and subject `3` in one department → **2 unique subjects**.  
- **Teacher 2** teaches 4 different subjects → **4 unique subjects**.

---

## Solution  

### ✅ SQL Query  
```sql
SELECT 
    teacher_id,
    COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id) AS cnt
FROM Teacher
GROUP BY 1;

```

---

### Explanation  

1. **`GROUP BY teacher_id`**: Groups the records per teacher.  
2. **`COUNT(DISTINCT subject_id)`**: Counts the number of different subjects taught by each teacher.  
3. **`AS cnt`**: Labels the resulting count column as `cnt`.  

---

## Notes  

- `DISTINCT` ensures that repeated subjects across departments are only counted once per teacher.  
- The result can be returned in any order unless otherwise specified.
