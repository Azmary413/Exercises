## üìò Table Definition

### Table: `RequestAccepted`

| Column Name   | Type | Description                                              |
|---------------|------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| requester_id  | int  | ID of the person who sent the friend request             |
| accepter_id   | int  | ID of the person who accepted the friend request         |
| accept_date   | date | Date the request was accepted                            |

- The combination `(requester_id, accepter_id)` is the primary key.
- Each row represents a successfully accepted friend request between two users.

## üéØ Goal

Find the user who has the **most total friends** and the **number of friends** they have.

### üìù Notes:
- A friendship is **bidirectional**: if user A is friends with B, then B is also friends with A.
- The result should include:
  - `id`: user ID of the person with the most friends.
  - `num`: total number of friends they have.
- Only one person will have the maximum number of friends in the given data.

## üìä Example

### Input

**RequestAccepted**

| requester_id | accepter_id | accept_date |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1            | 2           | 2016-06-03  |
| 1            | 3           | 2016-06-08  |
| 2            | 3           | 2016-06-08  |
| 3            | 4           | 2016-06-09  |

### Output

| id | num |
|----|-----|
| 3  | 3   |

### Explanation

- User 3 is friends with users 1, 2, and 4 ‚Üí total of **3 friends**.
- This is more than any other user.

---

## ‚úÖ SQL Solution (PostgreSQL)

```sql
SELECT id, COUNT(*) AS num
FROM (
  SELECT requester_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted
  UNION ALL
  SELECT accepter_id AS id FROM RequestAccepted
) AS all_friends
GROUP BY id
ORDER BY num DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

---

## üîç Explanation

1. **UNION ALL**:
   - We treat both `requester_id` and `accepter_id` as friends of each other.
   - This creates a single column of all friend connections (both sides).

2. **GROUP BY id**:
   - Groups by user ID to count how many times each user appears ‚Üí total number of friends.

3. **ORDER BY & LIMIT**:
   - Orders the users by their number of friends, descending.
   - Limits the result to only the top user.
