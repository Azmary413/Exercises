### Table: Followers  

| Column Name  | Type | Description                                                  |
|--------------|------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `user_id`    | int  | The ID of the user being followed.                           |
| `follower_id`| int  | The ID of the user who is following another user.            |

**Notes**:  
- `(user_id, follower_id)` is the **primary key**, meaning each follower can follow a user only once.  
- The table shows follower relationships for a social media platform.

---

## Goal  

Find the **number of followers** each user has and return a list sorted by `user_id`.

---

### Requirements  

1. Count how many followers each user has.  
2. Return two columns:  
   - `user_id`: the user who is being followed  
   - `followers_count`: the total number of users following them  
3. Order the results by `user_id` in ascending order.

---

### Example  

#### Input  

**Followers Table**  
| user_id | follower_id |
|---------|-------------|
| 0       | 1           |
| 1       | 0           |
| 2       | 0           |
| 2       | 1           |

---

#### Output  

| user_id | followers_count |
|---------|-----------------|
| 0       | 1               |
| 1       | 1               |
| 2       | 2               |

---

## Solution  

### âœ… SQL Query  
```sql
SELECT 
    user_id, 
    COUNT(follower_id) AS followers_count
FROM Followers
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY 1;

```

---

### Explanation  

1. **`GROUP BY user_id`**:  
   - Groups all rows by the user being followed.  

2. **`COUNT(follower_id)`**:  
   - Counts how many distinct users are following each user.  

3. **`ORDER BY user_id`**:  
   - Ensures the output is sorted by `user_id` in ascending order.  

---

## Notes  

- This query does not include users who are not followed by anyone. If required, a left join with a user table would be necessary.  
- The result shows **only active users with followers**.
