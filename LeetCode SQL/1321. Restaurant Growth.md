## üìò Table Definition

### Table: `Customer`

| Column Name | Type    | Description                          |
|-------------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| customer_id | int     | ID of the customer                   |
| name        | varchar | Name of the customer                 |
| visited_on  | date    | The date the customer visited        |
| amount      | int     | Amount paid by the customer (USD)    |

- `(customer_id, visited_on)` is the primary key.
- Each row represents a customer visit on a specific date.

---

## üéØ Goal

You need to report the **7-day rolling average** of total spending in the restaurant.

### ‚úÖ Requirements:
- For each day **starting from the 7th day**, calculate:
  - Total spending in the last 7 days (inclusive).
  - Average spending per day during this window (rounded to 2 decimals).
- Return the result ordered by `visited_on` ascending.

## üìä Example

### Input

| customer_id | name    | visited_on | amount |
|-------------|---------|------------|--------|
| 1           | Jhon    | 2019-01-01 | 100    |
| 2           | Daniel  | 2019-01-02 | 110    |
| 3           | Jade    | 2019-01-03 | 120    |
| 4           | Khaled  | 2019-01-04 | 130    |
| 5           | Winston | 2019-01-05 | 110    |
| 6           | Elvis   | 2019-01-06 | 140    |
| 7           | Elon    | 2019-01-07 | 150    |
| 8           | Elon    | 2019-01-08 | 80     |
| 9           | Winston | 2019-01-09 | 110    |
| 10          | Jhon    | 2019-01-10 | 280    |

### Output

| visited_on | amount | average_amount |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| 2019-01-07 | 860    | 122.86         |
| 2019-01-08 | 840    | 120.00         |
| 2019-01-09 | 840    | 120.00         |
| 2019-01-10 | 1000   | 142.86         |

## ‚úÖ SQL Solution (PostgreSQL)

```sql
WITH daily_amount AS (
  SELECT 
    visited_on,
    SUM(amount) AS total_amount
  FROM Customer
  GROUP BY visited_on
),
seven_day_rolling AS (
  SELECT 
    visited_on,
    SUM(total_amount) OVER (
      ORDER BY visited_on
      ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) AS amount,
    ROUND(AVG(total_amount) OVER (
      ORDER BY visited_on
      ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ), 2) AS average_amount
  FROM daily_amount
)
SELECT visited_on, amount, average_amount
FROM seven_day_rolling
WHERE visited_on >= (
  SELECT MIN(visited_on) + INTERVAL '6 day'
  FROM daily_amount
)
ORDER BY visited_on;
```

---

## üîç Explanation

1. **`daily_amount` CTE**:
   - Aggregates total `amount` per `visited_on` date, since multiple customers can visit on the same day.

2. **`seven_day_rolling` CTE**:
   - Uses window functions:
     - `SUM(...) OVER ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`: Calculates 7-day total spending.
     - `AVG(...) OVER ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`: Calculates 7-day average spending.

3. **Final SELECT**:
   - Filters only rows starting from the 7th day (first complete 7-day window).
   - Ensures the output is sorted by date as required.

---

### üß† Notes

- You **must group by date** before applying window functions, since multiple entries may exist for the same day.
