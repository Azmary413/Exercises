## 📘 Table Definitions

### Table: Logs

| Column Name | Type    | Description                              |
|-------------|---------|------------------------------------------|
| `id`        | int     | Primary key, auto-incrementing ID.       |
| `num`       | varchar | The number recorded in this log.         |

- `id` starts from 1 and increases sequentially.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Find and return all numbers that appear **at least three times consecutively** in the `Logs` table.

### Return:

- `ConsecutiveNums` – the number that appears three times in a row or more.

The output can be returned in any order.

## 📊 Example

### Input

**Logs**

| id | num |
|----|-----|
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |

### Output

| ConsecutiveNums |
|-----------------|
| 1               |

---

## ✅ SQL Solution (PostgreSQL)

```sql
WITH LogsNeighbors AS (
  SELECT
    *,
    LAG(num) OVER() AS prev_num,
    LEAD(num) OVER() AS next_num
  FROM LOGS
)
SELECT DISTINCT num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM LogsNeighbors
WHERE
  num = prev_num
  AND num = next_num;
```

---

## 🧠 Explanation

- `LAG(num) OVER()` fetches the number from the **previous row**.
- `LEAD(num) OVER()` fetches the number from the **next row**.
- If a row’s `num` is equal to both its previous and next rows' `num`, it indicates three consecutive identical values.
- `DISTINCT` ensures that each qualifying number is listed only once in the output.
