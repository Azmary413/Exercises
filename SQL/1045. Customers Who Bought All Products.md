## ðŸ“Š Example

### Input

**Customer**

| customer_id | product_key |
|-------------|-------------|
| 1           | 5           |
| 2           | 6           |
| 3           | 5           |
| 3           | 6           |
| 1           | 6           |

**Product**

| product_key |
|-------------|
| 5           |
| 6           |

### Output

| customer_id |
|-------------|
| 1           |
| 3           |

### Explanation:

Customers 1 and 3 have both purchased **all available products** (product keys 5 and 6). Customer 2 only bought product 6, so they are excluded.

## âœ… SQL Solution (Standard SQL / PostgreSQL)

```sql
SELECT customer_id
FROM Customer
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT product_key) = (
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Product
);
```

---

## ðŸ§  Explanation

- `GROUP BY customer_id`: Group the sales by customer.
- `COUNT(DISTINCT product_key)`: Count the unique products each customer bought.
- The `HAVING` clause filters for customers whose count of purchased distinct products is equal to the **total number of products** in the `Product` table.
- The subquery `(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Product)` returns the number of products that **must** be bought to qualify.
