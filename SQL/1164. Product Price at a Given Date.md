## üìò Table Definitions

### Table: Products

| Column Name   | Type    | Description                                                      |
|---------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `product_id`  | int     | Unique ID of each product.                                       |
| `new_price`   | int     | The updated price of the product.                                |
| `change_date` | date    | The date on which the price was changed.                        |

- The combination of `product_id` and `change_date` forms the **primary key**.
- Each row represents a price change for a product on a specific date.

## üéØ Goal

Find the **price of each product on `2019-08-16`**.  
If a product has **no price change before or on that date**, assume its price is **10** by default.

## üìä Example

### Input

**Products**

| product_id | new_price | change_date |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| 1          | 20        | 2019-08-14  |
| 2          | 50        | 2019-08-14  |
| 1          | 30        | 2019-08-15  |
| 1          | 35        | 2019-08-16  |
| 2          | 65        | 2019-08-17  |
| 3          | 20        | 2019-08-18  |

### Output

| product_id | price |
|------------|-------|
| 2          | 50    |
| 1          | 35    |
| 3          | 10    |

## ‚úÖ SQL Solution (PostgreSQL)

```sql
WITH LatestPrice AS (
    SELECT product_id, new_price
    FROM (
        SELECT *,
               RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY change_date DESC) AS rnk
        FROM Products
        WHERE change_date <= '2019-08-16'
    ) AS sub
    WHERE rnk = 1
),
AllProducts AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT product_id FROM Products
)
SELECT 
    ap.product_id,
    COALESCE(lp.new_price, 10) AS price
FROM AllProducts ap
LEFT JOIN LatestPrice lp ON ap.product_id = lp.product_id;
```

## üß† Explanation

- **LatestPrice CTE**: Retrieves the most recent price change on or before `'2019-08-16'` for each product using `RANK()`.
- **AllProducts CTE**: Lists all unique product IDs, ensuring that even products with no price updates before the date are included.
- **Final SELECT**: 
  - Joins the latest prices with all products.
  - Uses `COALESCE` to return a default price of `10` if no prior price is found.
