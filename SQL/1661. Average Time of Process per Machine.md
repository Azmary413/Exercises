### Table: Activity  

| Column Name   | Type    | Description                                                          |
|--------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `machine_id` | int     | The unique identifier for each machine.                             |
| `process_id` | int     | The unique identifier for each process running on a machine.       |
| `activity_type` | enum  | Represents whether the process is starting (`'start'`) or ending (`'end'`). |
| `timestamp`  | float   | The time at which the activity occurred (in seconds).               |

- The `(machine_id, process_id, activity_type)` combination serves as the primary key, ensuring unique values for each event.
- The `activity_type` column has two possible values: `'start'` and `'end'`, ensuring that each process has a defined start and end time.

---

## Goal  
Write a query to calculate the **average processing time per machine**, where processing time is calculated as the difference between `'end'` and `'start'` timestamps for each process.

### Requirements  
- The result should include two columns: `machine_id` and `processing_time`.  
- The `processing_time` should be rounded to 3 decimal places.  
- The result can be returned in any order.

## Example  

### Input  
**Activity Table**  

| machine_id | process_id | activity_type | timestamp |
|------------|------------|---------------|-----------|
| 0          | 0          | start         | 0.712     |
| 0          | 0          | end           | 1.520     |
| 0          | 1          | start         | 3.140     |
| 0          | 1          | end           | 4.120     |
| 1          | 0          | start         | 0.550     |
| 1          | 0          | end           | 1.550     |
| 1          | 1          | start         | 0.430     |
| 1          | 1          | end           | 1.420     |
| 2          | 0          | start         | 4.100     |
| 2          | 0          | end           | 4.512     |
| 2          | 1          | start         | 2.500     |
| 2          | 1          | end           | 5.000     |

### Output  

| machine_id | processing_time |
|------------|-----------------|
| 0          | 0.894           |
| 1          | 0.995           |
| 2          | 1.456           |

### Explanation  
- Machine **0**: ((1.520 - 0.712) + (4.120 - 3.140)) / 2 = **0.894**  
- Machine **1**: ((1.550 - 0.550) + (1.420 - 0.430)) / 2 = **0.995**  
- Machine **2**: ((4.512 - 4.100) + (5.000 - 2.500)) / 2 = **1.456**  

---

## Solution  

### SQL Query  
```sql
SELECT machine_id,
       ROUND(AVG(end_time - start_time), 3) AS processing_time
FROM (
    SELECT machine_id, process_id,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'end' THEN timestamp END) AS end_time,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'start' THEN timestamp END) AS start_time
    FROM Activity
    GROUP BY machine_id, process_id
) t
GROUP BY machine_id;
```

### Explanation  
1. **Subquery (`t`)**:
   - Groups by `machine_id` and `process_id` to obtain `start_time` and `end_time` using `CASE WHEN`.
   - Uses `MAX()` to extract the corresponding timestamps for `'start'` and `'end'` activities.
2. **Outer Query**:
   - Computes `end_time - start_time` to find the processing time for each process.
   - Averages these values using `AVG()`.
   - Rounds the result to 3 decimal places using `ROUND(..., 3)`.  

---

## Notes  
- The query ensures that each `(machine_id, process_id)` pair has exactly one `'start'` and one `'end'` entry.
- Using `CASE WHEN` inside `MAX()` helps in filtering out the correct timestamps.
- The final `AVG()` calculation provides the required processing time per machine.
