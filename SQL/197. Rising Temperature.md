### Table: Weather  

| Column Name   | Type    | Description                                      |
|---------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `id`          | int     | Unique identifier for each record.              |
| `recordDate`  | date    | The date of the temperature record.             |
| `temperature` | int     | The temperature recorded on the specific date.  |  
**Notes**:  
- The `id` column contains unique values.  
- There are no duplicate rows with the same `recordDate`.  

---

## Goal  

Write a query to find all the `id` values of dates where the temperature was higher than the temperature on the previous day.  

### Requirements  
1. Compare the `temperature` of each date with its previous day's temperature.  
2. Return the `id` column for all rows where the temperature is higher than the previous day.  
3. Return the result in any order.

## Example  

### Input  

**Weather Table**  
| id | recordDate | temperature |
|----|------------|-------------|
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |

---

### Output  

| id |
|----|
| 2  |
| 4  |

---

### Explanation  
- On `2015-01-02` (id = 2), the temperature (25) was higher than the previous day (`2015-01-01`, temperature = 10).  
- On `2015-01-04` (id = 4), the temperature (30) was higher than the previous day (`2015-01-03`, temperature = 20).  
- For `2015-01-01` and `2015-01-03`, the temperature did not increase compared to the previous day, so their `id` values are excluded.  

---

## Solution  

### SQL Query  
```sql
SELECT 
    w1.id
FROM 
    Weather w1
JOIN 
    Weather w2
ON 
    w1.recordDate = w2.recordDate + INTERVAL '1 day'
WHERE 
    w1.temperature > w2.temperature;
```

---

### Explanation  
1. **`JOIN`**: Self-joins the `Weather` table with itself (`w1` and `w2` aliases) to compare each row with the previous day's record.  
2. **`ON w1.recordDate = w2.recordDate + INTERVAL '1 day'`**: Matches a row in `w1` with the row in `w2` where the date in `w2` is exactly one day earlier than in `w1`.  
3. **`WHERE w1.temperature > w2.temperature`**: Filters rows where the temperature of the current day (`w1.temperature`) is higher than the previous day's temperature (`w2.temperature`).  
4. **`SELECT w1.id`**: Outputs the `id` column of dates meeting the condition.  

---

## Notes  
- The query efficiently finds temperature increases across consecutive days.  
- The `INTERVAL '1 day'` is critical for comparing dates offset by one day.  
- The result is sorted arbitrarily unless explicitly ordered.  

---

## Applications  
This query can be used in scenarios like:  
- Monitoring temperature trends.  
- Analyzing weather patterns for consecutive days.  
- Identifying days with significant changes in temperature.
