## 1075. Project Employees I  
**Difficulty**: Easy  
**Topics**: SQL, Aggregation, JOIN, Rounding  

### Table: Project  

| Column Name  | Type | Description                                                   |
|--------------|------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `project_id` | int  | ID of the project.                                            |
| `employee_id`| int  | ID of the employee working on the project.                    |

- (`project_id`, `employee_id`) is the **primary key**.  
- `employee_id` is a **foreign key** referencing `Employee.employee_id`.  
- Each row indicates that a specific employee is assigned to a project.  

### Table: Employee  

| Column Name      | Type    | Description                             |
|------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------|
| `employee_id`    | int     | Unique identifier for each employee.    |
| `name`           | varchar | Name of the employee.                   |
| `experience_years` | int   | Years of experience (non-NULL).         |

---

## Goal  
Write an SQL query to retrieve:  
- Each `project_id`,  
- The **average experience years** of employees assigned to that project.  

### Requirements:
- The result should contain two columns: `project_id` and `average_years`.  
- Round the average to **2 decimal places**.  
- Return the result in any order.

## Example  

### **Input**

**Project Table**  

| project_id | employee_id |
|------------|-------------|
| 1          | 1           |
| 1          | 2           |
| 1          | 3           |
| 2          | 1           |
| 2          | 4           |

**Employee Table**  

| employee_id | name   | experience_years |
|-------------|--------|------------------|
| 1           | Khaled | 3                |
| 2           | Ali    | 2                |
| 3           | John   | 1                |
| 4           | Doe    | 2                |

### **Output**

| project_id | average_years |
|------------|----------------|
| 1          | 2.00           |
| 2          | 2.50           |

### **Explanation**  
- For project **1**: Average = (3 + 2 + 1) / 3 = **2.00**  
- For project **2**: Average = (3 + 2) / 2 = **2.50**

---

## Solution  

### **SQL Query**  
```sql
SELECT 
    p.project_id,
    ROUND(AVG(e.experience_years), 2) AS average_years
FROM Project p
JOIN Employee e
ON p.employee_id = e.employee_id
GROUP BY 1;
```

### **Explanation**  
1. `JOIN` the `Project` and `Employee` tables using `employee_id`.  
2. Use `AVG(experience_years)` to calculate the average years of experience per project.  
3. `ROUND(..., 2)` ensures the average is rounded to two decimal places.  
4. `GROUP BY project_id` groups employees under each project.  

---

## Notes  
- The use of `ROUND(..., 2)` ensures precision in the result.  
- No filtering is required as all records are relevant.  
- This query handles projects with varying employee counts.
