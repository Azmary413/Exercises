## 1731. The Number of Employees Which Report to Each Employee  
**Difficulty**: Easy  
**Topics**: SQL, Self Join, Aggregation, Rounding  

### Table: Employees  

| Column Name  | Type    | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `employee_id`| int     | Unique ID of each employee.                                                 |
| `name`       | varchar | Name of the employee.                                                       |
| `reports_to` | int     | ID of the manager to whom the employee reports. `NULL` if they report to no one. |
| `age`        | int     | Age of the employee.                                                        |

- The table may contain employees who **do not report to anyone** (i.e., top-level managers).
- The same person can **both manage others and report to someone**.
- A manager is defined as an employee with **at least one direct report**.

---

## Goal  
Write a SQL query to return the **employee ID and name of each manager**, along with:  
1. **Number of direct reports**  
2. **Average age** of those reports, rounded to the **nearest integer**  

The output should be sorted by `employee_id`.

## Example  

### **Input**  
**Employees Table**  
| employee_id | name    | reports_to | age |
|-------------|---------|------------|-----|
| 9           | Hercy   | NULL       | 43  |
| 6           | Alice   | 9          | 41  |
| 4           | Bob     | 9          | 36  |
| 2           | Winston | NULL       | 37  |

### **Output**  
| employee_id | name  | reports_count | average_age |
|-------------|-------|----------------|-------------|
| 9           | Hercy | 2              | 39          |

### **Explanation**  
- **Hercy (ID 9)** manages **Alice and Bob**.  
- Their ages: 41 and 36 → Average = (41 + 36)/2 = 38.5 → Rounded to **39**.  
- Total reports = **2**.

---

## Solution  

### **SQL Query**  
```sql
SELECT 
    e.employee_id,
    e.name,
    COUNT(r.employee_id) AS reports_count,
    ROUND(AVG(r.age)) AS average_age
FROM Employees e
JOIN Employees r
    ON e.employee_id = r.reports_to
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1;
```

---

### **Explanation**  
1. **Self JOIN**:  
   - We join the `Employees` table with itself:  
     - `e` represents the **manager**,  
     - `r` represents the **reporting employee**.
2. **Join Condition**:  
   - `r.reports_to = e.employee_id` links employees to their manager.
3. **Aggregation**:  
   - `COUNT(r.employee_id)`: counts the number of direct reports for each manager.
   - `AVG(r.age)`: computes the average age of those reports.
   - `ROUND(...)`: rounds average to nearest whole number.
4. **Grouping**:  
   - Group by `employee_id` and `name` of the manager.
5. **Ordering**:  
   - The result is ordered by `employee_id` as required.

---

## Notes  
- Managers without any reports are automatically **excluded** due to the `JOIN` behavior.
