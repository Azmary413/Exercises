## ðŸ“˜ Table Definitions

### Table: Sales

| Column Name | Type  | Description                                               |
|-------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `sale_id`   | int   | Unique ID for each sale.                                  |
| `product_id`| int   | Foreign key referencing `Product.product_id`.             |
| `year`      | int   | The year the sale occurred.                               |
| `quantity`  | int   | Quantity of the product sold.                             |
| `price`     | int   | Price per unit of the product.                            |

- `(sale_id, year)` is the primary key of the table.

### Table: Product

| Column Name   | Type    | Description                    |
|---------------|---------|--------------------------------|
| `product_id`  | int     | Unique ID for each product.    |
| `product_name`| varchar | Name of the product.           |

- `product_id` is the primary key of the table.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

For each product, find all the sales made in its **first year** of being sold.

Return the following columns:
- `product_id`
- `first_year` (the first year the product was sold)
- `quantity`
- `price`

If a product was sold multiple times in its first year, include **all** those sales.

The result can be returned in any order.

## ðŸ“Š Example

### Input

**Sales**

| sale_id | product_id | year | quantity | price |
|---------|------------|------|----------|-------|
| 1       | 100        | 2008 | 10       | 5000  |
| 2       | 100        | 2009 | 12       | 5000  |
| 7       | 200        | 2011 | 15       | 9000  |

**Product**

| product_id | product_name |
|------------|--------------|
| 100        | Nokia        |
| 200        | Apple        |
| 300        | Samsung      |

### Output

| product_id | first_year | quantity | price |
|------------|------------|----------|-------|
| 100        | 2008       | 10       | 5000  |
| 200        | 2011       | 15       | 9000  |

## âœ… SQL Solution (Standard SQL / PostgreSQL)

```sql
SELECT product_id, year AS first_year, quantity, price
FROM Sales
WHERE (product_id, year) IN (
    SELECT product_id, MIN(year)
    FROM Sales
    GROUP BY product_id
);
```

---

## ðŸ§  Explanation

- `MIN(year)` is used to determine the **first year** each product was sold.
- The subquery groups by `product_id` and gets the minimum year for each.
- The outer query uses a `WHERE IN` filter on `(product_id, year)` to return **only the sales** that occurred in that first year.
- All sales for that year are included, regardless of quantity or price.
