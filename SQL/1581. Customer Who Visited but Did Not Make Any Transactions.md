### Table 1: Visits  

| Column Name | Type    | Description                                             |
|-------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `visit_id`  | int     | Unique identifier for each visit.                       |
| `customer_id` | int   | Unique identifier for each customer.                    |
This table contains information about the customers who visited the mall.  

---

### Table 2: Transactions  

| Column Name    | Type    | Description                                             |
|----------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `transaction_id` | int   | Unique identifier for each transaction.                 |
| `visit_id`     | int     | Identifier for the visit associated with the transaction.|
| `amount`       | int     | Amount spent during the transaction.                    |
This table contains information about the transactions made during a visit.  

---

## Goal  

Write a query to find the `customer_id` of customers who visited the mall but did not make any transactions, along with the number of times they made such visits.  

### Requirements  
1. Identify visits from the `Visits` table that do not have matching entries in the `Transactions` table.  
2. Count the number of visits without transactions for each customer.  
3. Return the columns `customer_id` and `count_no_trans` (number of visits without transactions).  
4. Sort the result in any order.

## Example  

### Input  

**Visits Table**  
| visit_id | customer_id |
|----------|-------------|
| 1        | 23          |
| 2        | 9           |
| 4        | 30          |
| 5        | 54          |
| 6        | 96          |
| 7        | 54          |
| 8        | 54          |

**Transactions Table**  
| transaction_id | visit_id | amount |
|----------------|----------|--------|
| 2              | 5        | 310    |
| 3              | 5        | 300    |
| 9              | 5        | 200    |
| 12             | 1        | 910    |
| 13             | 2        | 970    |

---

### Output  

| customer_id | count_no_trans |
|-------------|----------------|
| 54          | 2              |
| 30          | 1              |
| 96          | 1              |

---

### Explanation  
1. Customers 23 and 9 made transactions during their visits and are excluded.  
2. Customer 30 visited the mall once and made no transactions.  
3. Customer 54 visited three times but made no transactions on two visits.  
4. Customer 96 visited the mall once and made no transactions.  

---

## Solution  

### SQL Query  
```sql
SELECT 
    v.customer_id,
    COUNT(*) AS count_no_trans
FROM 
    Visits v
LEFT JOIN 
    Transactions t
ON 
    v.visit_id = t.visit_id
WHERE 
    t.visit_id IS NULL
GROUP BY 
    v.customer_id;
```

---

### Explanation  
1. **`LEFT JOIN`**: Combines the `Visits` table with the `Transactions` table. All rows from `Visits` are retained, and unmatched rows in `Transactions` are filled with `NULL`.  
2. **`WHERE t.visit_id IS NULL`**: Filters out rows where a matching transaction exists, retaining only visits with no transactions.  
3. **`COUNT(*)`**: Counts the number of visits without transactions for each customer.  
4. **`GROUP BY v.customer_id`**: Groups the results by `customer_id` to compute the count per customer.  

---

## Notes  
- The query efficiently identifies customers who did not make any transactions during their visits.  
- The result can be used for customer behavior analysis, such as identifying users who may need targeted promotions or engagement strategies.
