You are given a table `Customer` with the following schema:

| Column Name | Type    |
|------------|---------|
| id         | int     |
| name       | varchar |
| referee_id | int     |

- `id` is the primary key.
- Each row represents a customer, their name, and the `id` of the customer who referred them.
- Find the names of customers **not referred by** the customer with `id = 2`.
- Return the result table in any order.

### Example

#### **Input:**

```
Customer table:
+----+------+------------+
| id | name | referee_id |
+----+------+------------+
| 1  | Will | null       |
| 2  | Jane | null       |
| 3  | Alex | 2          |
| 4  | Bill | null       |
| 5  | Zack | 1          |
| 6  | Mark | 2          |
+----+------+------------+
```

#### **Output:**

```
+------+
| name |
+------+
| Will |
| Jane |
| Bill |
| Zack |
+------+
```

---

## SQL Solution

```sql
SELECT name 
FROM Customer
WHERE referee_id IS NULL OR referee_id <> 2;
```

### **Explanation:**
- `referee_id IS NULL`: Includes customers who were **not referred by anyone**.
- `referee_id <> 2`: Excludes customers who were referred by **customer with id = 2**.
