### 1280. Students and Examinations  
**Difficulty**: Easy  
**Topics**: SQL, Data Analysis  
**Schema**: SQL Schema, Pandas Schema  

### Table: Students  

| Column Name   | Type    | Description                                  |
|--------------|---------|----------------------------------------------|
| `student_id` | int     | The unique identifier for each student (primary key). |
| `student_name` | varchar | The name of the student.                     |

- The `student_id` column serves as the primary key, ensuring unique values for each student.

### Table: Subjects  

| Column Name  | Type    | Description                                  |
|-------------|---------|----------------------------------------------|
| `subject_name` | varchar | The name of the subject (primary key).       |

- The `subject_name` column serves as the primary key, ensuring unique values for each subject.

### Table: Examinations  

| Column Name  | Type    | Description                                  |
|-------------|---------|----------------------------------------------|
| `student_id` | int     | The ID of the student taking the exam.       |
| `subject_name` | varchar | The name of the subject for the exam.        |

- There is no primary key in this table, meaning it may contain duplicate rows.
- Each row in this table represents an instance where a student attended an exam for a subject.

### Criteria for Exam Attendance  
A student's exam attendance is determined by counting how many times they appear in the `Examinations` table for each subject.

---

## Goal  
Write a query to find the number of times each student attended each exam.  

### Requirements  
- The result should include four columns: `student_id`, `student_name`, `subject_name`, and `attended_exams`.  
- The result should be ordered by `student_id` and `subject_name`.

## Example  

### Input  
**Students Table**  

| student_id | student_name |
|------------|--------------|
| 1          | Alice        |

| 13         | John         |
| 6          | Alex         |

**Subjects Table**  

| subject_name  |
|--------------|
| Math         |
| Physics      |
| Programming  |

**Examinations Table**  

| student_id | subject_name |
|------------|--------------|
| 1          | Math         |
| 1          | Physics      |
| 1          | Programming  |
| 2          | Programming  |

| 13         | Math         |
| 13         | Programming  |
| 13         | Physics      |
| 2          | Math         |
| 1          | Math         |

### Output  

| student_id | student_name | subject_name | attended_exams |
|------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| 1          | Alice        | Math         | 3              |
| 1          | Alice        | Physics      | 2              |
| 1          | Alice        | Programming  | 1              |
| 2          | Bob          | Math         | 1              |
| 2          | Bob          | Physics      | 0              |
| 2          | Bob          | Programming  | 1              |
| 6          | Alex         | Math         | 0              |
| 6          | Alex         | Physics      | 0              |
| 6          | Alex         | Programming  | 0              |
| 13         | John         | Math         | 1              |
| 13         | John         | Physics      | 1              |
| 13         | John         | Programming  | 1              |

## Solution  

### SQL Query  
```sql
SELECT s.student_id, s.student_name, sub.subject_name,
       COUNT(e.subject_name) AS attended_exams
FROM Students s
CROSS JOIN Subjects sub
LEFT JOIN Examinations e
ON s.student_id = e.student_id AND sub.subject_name = e.subject_name
GROUP BY s.student_id, s.student_name, sub.subject_name
ORDER BY s.student_id, sub.subject_name;
```

### Explanation  
1. **`CROSS JOIN Subjects sub` Clause**: Ensures that every student is paired with every subject.
2. **`LEFT JOIN Examinations e` Clause**: Links the `Examinations` table to count occurrences of each student-subject pair.
3. **`COUNT(e.subject_name)` Clause**: Counts the number of times a student attended an exam for each subject.
4. **`GROUP BY` Clause**: Groups the data by student and subject to generate unique rows.
5. **`ORDER BY student_id, subject_name` Clause**: Ensures the result is sorted as required.

---

## Notes  
- The `CROSS JOIN` ensures that all students appear for all subjects even if they never attended an exam.
- The `LEFT JOIN` ensures students with no exams appear with `attended_exams = 0`.
