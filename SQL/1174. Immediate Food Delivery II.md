## ðŸ“˜ Table Definitions

### Table: Delivery

| Column Name                 | Type | Description                                                   |
|----------------------------|------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `delivery_id`              | int  | Unique ID for each delivery.                                  |
| `customer_id`              | int  | ID of the customer placing the order.                         |
| `order_date`               | date | The date the order was placed.                                |
| `customer_pref_delivery_date` | date | The preferred delivery date selected by the customer.        |

- `delivery_id` is the primary key.
- Each customer has **exactly one first order**, defined as the earliest order by `order_date`.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Calculate the **percentage of first orders that were immediate**:

- An **immediate order** is when `order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date`.
- Round the result to **2 decimal places**.
- Return a single column: `immediate_percentage`.

## ðŸ“Š Example

### Input

**Delivery**

| delivery_id | customer_id | order_date | customer_pref_delivery_date |
|-------------|-------------|------------|-----------------------------|
| 1           | 1           | 2019-08-01 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 2           | 2           | 2019-08-02 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 3           | 1           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-12                  |
| 4           | 3           | 2019-08-24 | 2019-08-24                  |
| 5           | 3           | 2019-08-21 | 2019-08-22                  |
| 6           | 2           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-13                  |
| 7           | 4           | 2019-08-09 | 2019-08-09                  |

### Output

| immediate_percentage |
|----------------------|
| 50.00                |

## âœ… SQL Solution (PostgreSQL)

```sql
WITH first_orders AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM Delivery d
    WHERE NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM Delivery d2
        WHERE d.customer_id = d2.customer_id
          AND d2.order_date < d.order_date
    )
)
SELECT 
    ROUND(
        100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) 
        / COUNT(*), 
        2
    ) AS immediate_percentage
FROM first_orders;
```

---

## ðŸ§  Explanation

- **CTE `first_orders`**: Identifies each customer's first order using a `NOT EXISTS` subquery.
- **`SUM(CASE WHEN ...)`**: Counts how many of those first orders were immediate.
- **`COUNT(*)`**: Gets the total number of first orders.
- **`ROUND(..., 2)`**: Rounds the final percentage to two decimal places.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

- This solution guarantees inclusion of only the earliest order for each customer.
- The percentage is calculated based only on those **first** orders.
