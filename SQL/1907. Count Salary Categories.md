## ðŸ“˜ Table Definition

### Table: `Accounts`

| Column Name | Type | Description                         |
|-------------|------|-------------------------------------|
| account_id  | int  | Primary key for the bank account.   |
| income      | int  | Monthly income for the account.     |

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Count how many bank accounts fall into each **salary category**:

- **Low Salary**: Income **< $20000**
- **Average Salary**: Income **between $20000 and $50000 (inclusive)**
- **High Salary**: Income **> $50000**

**Return all three categories**, even if no accounts fall into one.

## ðŸ“Š Example

### Input

**Accounts**

| account_id | income |
|------------|--------|
| 3          | 108939 |
| 2          | 12747  |
| 8          | 87709  |
| 6          | 91796  |

### Output

| category        | accounts_count |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Low Salary      | 1              |
| Average Salary  | 0              |
| High Salary     | 3              |

## âœ… SQL Solution (PostgreSQL)

```sql
SELECT 
  'Low Salary' AS category,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE income < 20000) AS accounts_count
FROM Accounts

UNION

SELECT 
  'Average Salary' AS category,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE income BETWEEN 20000 AND 50000) AS accounts_count
FROM Accounts

UNION

SELECT 
  'High Salary' AS category,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE income > 50000) AS accounts_count
FROM Accounts;
```

---

## ðŸ§  Explanation

- This solution uses **three separate `SELECT` statements** combined via `UNION` to ensure all categories are included.
- **`FILTER (WHERE ...)`** is used to conditionally count rows based on income range.
- The fixed category label in each `SELECT` ensures all three categories appear, even if count = 0.
