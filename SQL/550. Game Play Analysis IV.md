## ðŸ“˜ Table Definition

### Table: Activity

| Column Name  | Type | Description                                          |
|--------------|------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `player_id`  | int  | ID of the player.                                    |
| `device_id`  | int  | ID of the device used.                               |
| `event_date` | date | Date of the activity.                                |
| `games_played` | int | Number of games played during this session.         |

- `(player_id, event_date)` is the **primary key**.
- Each row represents a session of a player logging in and playing (or not).

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Calculate the **fraction of players** who logged in **again on the day after their first login**, rounded to **2 decimal places**.

---

## ðŸ“Š Example

### Input

**Activity**

| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
|-----------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |

### Output

| fraction |
|----------|
| 0.33     |

## âœ… SQL Solution (PostgreSQL)

```sql
WITH first_login AS (
    SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS first_date
    FROM Activity
    GROUP BY player_id
),
next_day_login AS (
    SELECT a.player_id
    FROM Activity a
    JOIN first_login f
      ON a.player_id = f.player_id
     AND a.event_date = f.first_date + INTERVAL '1 day'
)
SELECT 
    ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT n.player_id) * 1.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT f.player_id), 2) AS fraction
FROM first_login f
LEFT JOIN next_day_login n ON f.player_id = n.player_id;
```

---

## ðŸ§  Explanation

1. **`first_login` CTE**: Gets each player's first login date.
2. **`next_day_login` CTE**: Finds players who logged in **exactly the day after** their first login.
3. **Final SELECT**:
   - Counts how many players had a "next day" login.
   - Divides it by the total number of players.
   - Multiplies by `1.0` to ensure **float division**.
   - Uses `ROUND(..., 2)` to return result to **two decimal places**.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

- The use of `INTERVAL '1 day'` is a safe and readable way to compare dates in PostgreSQL.
- `LEFT JOIN` ensures we include all players (even those who didnâ€™t return the next day).
- `DISTINCT` is necessary to avoid duplicates.
