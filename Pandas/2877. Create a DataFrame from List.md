# Create a DataFrame from List

## Problem Description

Write a solution to create a **DataFrame** from a 2D list called `student_data`. This 2D list contains the IDs and ages of students. The goal is to generate a DataFrame with the following properties:

- The DataFrame should have two columns: `student_id` and `age`.
- The order of rows in the DataFrame should match the original `student_data`.

### Example

#### Input:
```python
student_data = [
    [1, 15],
    [2, 11],
    [3, 11],
    [4, 20]
]
```

#### Output:
```
+------------+-----+
| student_id | age |
+------------+-----+
| 1          | 15  |
| 2          | 11  |
| 3          | 11  |
| 4          | 20  |
+------------+-----+
```

#### Explanation:
A DataFrame is created with two columns: `student_id` and `age`, based on the `student_data` input list. The rows remain in the same order as the input data.

## Solution

This problem is solved using Python and the **Pandas** library, which is commonly used for data manipulation and analysis. The solution involves creating a DataFrame using `pd.DataFrame()` and specifying the column names.

### Code Implementation
```python
import pandas as pd
from typing import List

def createDataframe(student_data: List[List[int]]) -> pd.DataFrame:
    # Create a DataFrame from the 2D list with specified column names
    df = pd.DataFrame(student_data, columns=["student_id", "age"])
    return df
```

---

## How to Run the Solution

1. Install the required library if not already installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```
2. Save the code to a Python file (e.g., `create_dataframe.py`).
3. Call the function with the `student_data` as input:
   ```python
   student_data = [
       [1, 15],
       [2, 11],
       [3, 11],
       [4, 20]
   ]
   df = createDataframe(student_data)
   print(df)
   ```

---

## Output Example
For the given input:
```python
student_data = [
    [1, 15],
    [2, 11],
    [3, 11],
    [4, 20]
]
```

The output will be:
```
   student_id  age
0           1   15
1           2   11
2           3   11
3           4   20
```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas library

---

## Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of rows in `student_data`.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), for storing the DataFrame in memory.
